<!--
## Before reporting
 - Search for the suggestion here. It's possible someone's suggested it before!
 - In particular, see issue #196 and the 'Mod integration' project.
-->

## Useful information to include:
 - Explanation of how the feature/change should work.
 - Some rationale/use case for a feature. I'd like to keep Plethora as minimal as possible, so I like to have a solid justification for each feature.
 - Detailed use cases, possibly with pseudo-code, can improve the chances of your suggestion being implemented.
