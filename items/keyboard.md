			The trouble with computers, is that it's very easy to spend all the time looking at a screen and not notice
			all the things going on around you: the grass, the trees, the creeper behind you. Monitors help in their own
			way, but there's only so much you can hope to achieve by punching a screen. Thankfully we have a solution:
			the keyboard. Simply bind it to any computer, and type away wherever you are. Enjoy the luxury of the big
			screen!

### Using with computers
Getting started with a keyboard couldn't be easier: simply walk up to the computer you want to type at and shift +
right-click it whilst holding the keyboard. You'll notice that the keyboard now reports where it is bound to:

![A keyboard bound to a computer.]({{ "images/items/keyboard-bound.png" | relative_url }} "A keyboard bound to a computer.")

One can now use the keyboard anywhere in the world to type at this computer: simply right click it and tap away! Once
you have finished typing, press escape to resume normal play.

### Using with the neural interface
While the neural interface is a fantastic piece of technology, it is rather frustrating having to dig out your neural
connector every time you want to use it. Thankfully this is no longer the case: you only have to dig out a keyboard
instead! As long as your keyboard is not bound to any computer, using it whilst wearing a neural interface will type on
your headpiece instead. In conjunction with the overlay glasses, you can create all sorts of convenient interfaces.

One can also place the keyboard in a _module slot_ of a neural interface. Doing so will mean key presses are continually
relayed to the interface, even when not in in the keyboard's GUI. Consequently you can add your own keybindings,
triggering all sorts of actions.
